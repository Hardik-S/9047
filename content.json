        "content": "Supposition, in Peter of Spain's framework, is the way a term in a proposition stands in for what it signifies, so that the sentence is about things in the world rather than just about words. The idea is that when we reason, a spoken or written term is \"put in place of\" the thing it signifies, and different kinds of supposition mark different patterns in how that substitution works (for example, whether the term ranges over a universal, a single individual, or many individuals at once). Supposition is always context-sensitive: it belongs to the term as it appears in a specific proposition and position, not to the word in isolation."

        "content": "Simple supposition is the pattern in which a common term stands, not for individual things, but for the universal or kind that it signifies. Instead of ranging over \u201clower\u201d items in a genus-species hierarchy, the term refers to the species or genus itself, considered as a single, abstract entity. This is how we speak when doing classification or metaphysics rather than describing particular members: we are talking about what the kind is, not which individuals fall under it. Simple supposition thus contrasts with personal supposition, where the same term would stand for concrete instances."

        "content": "Personal supposition is the pattern in which a common term stands for the individual things \"below\" it in the logical hierarchy, so that the proposition is about actual members of the relevant kind rather than about the universal itself. This is the dominant, everyday mode of speech: when we say \u201chumans,\u201d \u201ccats,\u201d or \u201cstudents,\u201d we are usually talking about concrete individuals who walk around, act, and change. In Peter of Spain's taxonomy, personal supposition is the main branch under which more fine-grained kinds like determinate and confused supposition are sorted, depending on how the term ranges over its many possible bearers."

        "content": "Discrete supposition is the kind of supposition had by discrete terms, expressions whose reference is fixed on a particular individual rather than a whole class. Instead of ranging over many possible instances, the term directly picks out a single thing, so the proposition is straightforwardly about that individual. Peter of Spain treats proper names and demonstratives as paradigmatic discrete terms, since they are designed to latch onto one item rather than a universal. In this way, discrete supposition is the \u201cmost determinate\u201d kind of standing-for: there is exactly one bearer in view."

Nouns like \u201chuman,\u201d adjectives like \u201cwhite,\u201d and many verbs are common in this sense: they are not tied to one particular thing but are, in principle, apt to be truly predicated of many. When a term has common supposition, it does not, by itself, single out one bearer; instead, it opens up a field of possible instances that more specific grammatical devices (like quantifiers and modifiers) can then shape. This makes common supposition the natural starting point for talking about species, properties, and repeatable features."

The individual in question is not named, but the logical form allows you to descend to a single particular and preserve truth: if the sentence is true, it is because one concrete instance makes it so. Determinate supposition is characteristic of terms used indefinitely or with particular signs like \u201ca,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d or \u201ca certain.\u201d"

Here the term\u2019s reference is \u201cspread out\u201d over its whole extension: the proposition is true only if what is said holds of all the relevant things, or at least in a way that cannot be captured by singling out one instance. This kind of supposition is typically triggered by universal signs like \u201cevery,\u201d which force the term to range across its entire (or at least a broad) field of application."

When supposition is movable and distributive, a universally quantified statement commits you to every individual in the class, so that from the general claim you can infer a whole series of singular instances. The \u201cmovable\u201d label signals that you can move from the universal to these particulars; \u201cdistributive\u201d signals that the property in question is distributed across them."

The proposition treats the term\u2019s many bearers as an undivided totality or range, and carving out one of them on its own can distort the logical shape of what is being asserted. In such cases, the term\u2019s supposition is \u201cconfused\u201d because it ranges over many, but \u201cimmovable\u201d because you cannot safely move from the general statement to parallel singular ones."
