        "content": "Supposition, in Peter of Spain's framework, is the way a term in a proposition stands in for what it signifies, so that the sentence is about things in the world rather than just about words. The idea is that when we reason, a spoken or written term is \"put in place of\" the thing it signifies, and different kinds of supposition mark different patterns in how that substitution works (for example, whether the term ranges over a universal, a single individual, or many individuals at once). Supposition is always context-sensitive: it belongs to the term as it appears in a specific proposition and position, not to the word in isolation."

Instead of ranging over \"lower\" items in a genus-species hierarchy, the term refers to the species or genus itself, considered as a single, abstract entity. This is how we speak when doing classification or metaphysics rather than describing particular members: we are talking about what the kind is, not which individuals fall under it. Simple supposition thus contrasts with personal supposition, where the same term would stand for concrete instances."

This is the dominant, everyday mode of speech: when we say \"humans,\" \"cats,\" or \"students,\" we are usually talking about concrete individuals who walk around, act, and change. In Peter of Spain's taxonomy, personal supposition is the main branch under which more fine-grained kinds like determinate and confused supposition are sorted, depending on how the term ranges over its many possible bearers."

        "content": "Discrete supposition is the kind of supposition had by discrete terms, expressions whose reference is fixed on a particular individual rather than a whole class. Instead of ranging over many possible instances, the term directly picks out a single thing, so the proposition is straightforwardly about that individual. Peter of Spain treats proper names and demonstratives as paradigmatic discrete terms, since they are designed to latch onto one item rather than a universal. In this way, discrete supposition is the \"most determinate\" kind of standing-for: there is exactly one bearer in view."

Nouns like \"human,\" adjectives like \"white,\" and many verbs are common in this sense: they are not tied to one particular thing but are, in principle, apt to be truly predicated of many. When a term has common supposition, it does not, by itself, single out one bearer; instead, it opens up a field of possible instances that more specific grammatical devices (like quantifiers and modifiers) can then shape. This makes common supposition the natural starting point for talking about species, properties, and repeatable features."

The individual in question is not named, but the logical form allows you to descend to a single particular and preserve truth: if the sentence is true, it is because one concrete instance makes it so. Determinate supposition is characteristic of terms used indefinitely or with particular signs like \"a,\" \"some,\" or \"a certain.\""

When supposition is movable and distributive, a universally quantified statement commits you to every individual in the class, so that from the general claim you can infer a whole series of singular instances. The \"movable\" label signals that you can move from the universal to these particulars; \"distributive\" signals that the property in question is distributed across them."

The proposition treats the term\u2019s many bearers as an undivided totality or range, and carving out one of them on its own can distort the logical shape of what is being asserted. In such cases, the term\u2019s supposition is \"confused\" because it ranges over many, but \"immovable\" because you cannot safely move from the general statement to parallel singular ones."

When a term has natural supposition, it ranges over all the individuals that fall under its ordinary signification, and it can do so across times: past, present, and future. This is the \"maximal\" extension of the term, driven purely by what it means, not by extra temporal or modal operators. Natural supposition therefore describes how a bare common term would stand for its kind if nothing else in the sentence narrowed its reach."

Instead of standing for everything it could naturally signify, the term now stands only for a designated subset (or specially marked portion) of its extension, where that restriction comes from how the whole proposition is built. In this way, accidental supposition makes clear that terms do not supposit in a vacuum: what they stand for is shaped by temporal, modal, and logical structure."
