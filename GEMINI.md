# Project Overview

This is a simple, single-page web application that displays information about Peter of Spain's "Supposition Theory". The application presents a main view with a tree structure on a canvas, and allows the user to navigate to "simplified" and "English" views of the content. It also features an interactive list of terms that, when clicked, display additional information.

## Main Technologies

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Libraries:** No external libraries are used.

## Architecture

The application follows a simple, single-page architecture:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the page.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet that provides the visual presentation.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the application logic, including view navigation and interactive content.

# Building and Running

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No build process is required.

# Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The code is not formatted with any particular linter or style guide.
*   **Testing:** There are no tests in this project.
