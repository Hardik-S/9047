# Design Choices for the Tree Website

Please answer the following questions to provide direction for the website's design. Your input will help shape the visual and interactive elements of the project.

## 1. Overall Aesthetic

*   What kind of overall look and feel are you aiming for? (e.g., modern, classic, minimalist, playful, academic, mystical, futuristic, organic)
*   Should the design evoke a particular mood or atmosphere?

## 2. Color Palette

*   Are there any specific colors you prefer or want to avoid?
*   Should the current dark blue/gold theme be maintained, or do you envision something different?
*   How should colors be used to differentiate between interactive and static elements?

## 3. Typography

*   Do you have any preferences for fonts? (e.g., serif for classic feel, sans-serif for modern, monospace for technical)
*   Should there be a clear hierarchy in font sizes and styles for headings, body text, and interactive elements?
*   Are there any specific font pairings you like?

## 4. Layout

*   Is the current two-column layout (Display Window on left, Info Window on right) satisfactory, or do you prefer a different arrangement (e.g., single column, multi-row, dynamic)?
*   How important is responsiveness across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)? Should the layout adapt significantly, or is a fixed-width approach acceptable for certain elements?

## 5. Interactivity

*   How should the highlighting of grid cells and list items behave? (e.g., subtle glow, prominent color change, animation, pulse effect)
*   Are there any other interactive elements you'd like to incorporate (e.g., drag-and-drop, zoom, tooltips)?
*   How should user feedback be provided for interactions (e.g., visual cues, sound effects)?

## 6. Imagery

*   How should the main tree image be presented? (e.g., static, animated, with overlays, as a background element)
*   Are there any other images or visual elements you'd like to add to enhance the theme or content?
*   Should images be high-resolution, stylized, or abstract?

## 7. User Experience (UX)

*   What is the primary goal for the user's experience on this website? (e.g., easy information retrieval, immersive exploration, educational tool, artistic presentation)
*   How intuitive should the navigation and interaction be for a first-time user?
*   Are there any accessibility considerations that are particularly important (e.g., high contrast, keyboard navigation)?

## 8. Versioning

*   Do you want the version number to be prominently displayed, or can it be subtle?
*   Is the current placement satisfactory?
